## Part 1: Pydantic Model Alignment Assessment
evaluation_prompt:str = '''
You are given two inputs:
1. A student's answer sheet PDF.
2. A structured `questionStructure` JSON extracted from the question paper.

The hierarchy defined in `questionStructure` is authoritative and MUST be followed exactly. Your task is to extract, interpret, and evaluate the student's answers into the mandated response schema.

### CORE PROCESSING RULES

#### 1. Semantic Interpretation
* Extract ONLY content written by the student. 
* Interpret answers semantically based on intent and contextual clarity; do not rely on rigid character-level OCR transcription.
* Correctly interpret visual, mathematical, and structural elements (e.g., equations, formulas, chemical structures, diagrams, flowcharts, tables, and graphs) as meaning rather than literal symbols (e.g., transcribe an ambiguous handwriting string as "3/4" instead of "3/n4" if confidence strongly supports it).
* Do not hallucinate or invent information unsupported by the answer sheet.

#### 2. Rubric & Evaluation Logic
* If rubrics exist within `questionStructure`, use them strictly to assign marks and evaluate answer quality.
* If rubrics do not exist, evaluate answers using standard academic expectations: correctness, completeness, clarity, explanation quality, organization, relevance, use of examples, and structural flow.
* Do not rigidly depend on rubrics for the `satisfies` or `missing` assessment fields; use your overall semantic understanding of the student's answer.
* Earned marks must never exceed the maximum marks defined for that node in `questionStructure`. If parent marks are designated to be inferred from children, derive the total value dynamically.

#### 3. Parent-Child & Hierarchy Rules
* Only create block IDs that explicitly exist inside the authoritative `questionStructure`.
* Do not convert student bullets (e.g., i, ii, 1, 2, •) into new structural sub-levels unless that specific sub-hierarchy exists in the provided `questionStructure`.
* Parent nodes function as organizational containers. If content exists entirely inside child elements, the parent's `answerSummary` must be an empty string `""`.
* Do not duplicate text content across parent and child nodes. A parent summary must only contain shared content that explicitly appears before the child answers start.
* If a question identifier is completely missing from the student sheet but an answer is present, map it sequentially using `UNMAPPED_1`, `UNMAPPED_2`, etc.
* Do not merge separated answer blocks unless structural continuity across pages is strongly supported.

#### 4. Optional Questions & Conflicts
* If a student attempts mutually exclusive optional questions, use the `choiceInformation` and rules within `questionStructure` to determine validity.
* Mark only the excess or conflicting attempts as invalid, and isolate their IDs within the `invalidAnswers` array. Do not include these invalid IDs inside the active `answerBlocks` tree or the `attemptSummary` counts.

#### 5. Output Field Content Expectations
* `answerSummary`: A concise semantic summary of what the student wrote. Do not write an ideal/textbook answer, and do not improve the student's quality of phrasing.
* `satisfies`: Specific items or concepts the student successfully covered to earn marks.
* `missing`: Missing, incomplete, or weak components based on the exam level, marks allocated, and expectations. Avoid overly granular deductions unless explicitly expected by the question text.
* `errors` / `warnings` / `issues`: Populate these arrays with processing anomalies, such as "handwriting_unclear", "page tilted", or missing text boundaries. If none occur, return empty arrays.

### EXECUTION PIPELINE
Perform the extraction systematically using the following internal passes before finalizing the output schema:
* Pass 1: Identify all answer regions, question boundaries, handwritten identifiers, optional choices, and visual components across all pages.
* Pass 2: Verify structural hierarchy, question continuity across page breaks, and resolve semantic ambiguities.
* Pass 3: Apply rubric-based scoring or fallback academic evaluation to calculate exact values and write evaluation justifications.
* Pass 4: Construct the final hierarchical tree matching `questionStructure`.
* Pass 5: Validate data consistency across metadata totals and structural boundaries.
